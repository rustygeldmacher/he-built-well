AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JOHANN KONRAD DAEHLER
TRANSLATED BY LOUIS A. DAEHLER, 1974

PREFACE

The world, or I would like to say, the entire
human race, has a history of which different incidents
and events of various periods of time have been gathered
together by intelligent men. These are of certain value
to posterity if they are written down in their true mean-
ing and without prejudice. So also a nation; aver vy; oa
village, yes even the individual human being, has a
history that could be of importance to his posterity,
even if it be only to satisfy curiosity.

I have been in contact with the world for almost
seventy-one years, yes even to know the customs of two
continents. This has caused me to write my so-called
autobiography. This means only my personal experiences
as far as I am able to remember them, for the curiosity
of my children and grandchildren.
