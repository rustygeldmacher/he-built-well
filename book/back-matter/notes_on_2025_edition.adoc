== Notes on the 2025 Edition

Here's what I've modified:

* Rebuilt the table of contents
* Renamed the original first "preface" to "foreword" since it was not written
  by the author
* Reformatted and fixed some typos in the genealogy
* Ignored divorce dates in genealogy -- might go back and add later
* Removed all hyphenated words at end of lines and combined them
* Fixed a few typos and mis-spellings
* "Notes on the Daehler Ancestry" (Appendix B) had Daehler spelled "Dahler" --
  changes this to the correct spelling
