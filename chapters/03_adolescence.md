ADOLESCENCE

During the first two years, namely 1825 and 1826,
my apprenticeship in the carpentry trade was mostly re-
pair work on old buildings. In Gonterskirchen in the
spring of 1826, however, a new barn was built by the elder
Hannes Kloze for his daughter and her husband. There was
other work in that village including additional work on a
dwelling that had originally been built by my father for
David Graf in 1819 and that had not yet been occupied.
First stairs were made. One oak log had been held back,
and it had to be cut by my father, his brother, and me into
suitable boards. It was rather cold and was late in the
fall; still we were sweating. The log had been cut several
years before and had dried in the sun; this made it hard to
cut in spite of all our effort. This marked the first time
that I had secretly cried during work because it was too
hard and sour for me.

Anyone who would like to judge this kind of work
should do it with his own hands first. He would have to
convert himself into a saw mill. Before one can stand the
work, it has to become a habit. It was worse in the morning
at four o'clock; then I was wakened in the barn and bones
felt as though they were being tortured. They remained quite
stiff until I had been cutting again for a while; this warmed
up the body and by and by everything went the usual way once
more. In short the function of the body as a machine was
regained.

At seven o'clock we were called for breakfast; one
did not wait to be called a second time. Eating was always
done in a hurry; and no rest was taken. At noon dinner was
served; and at three-thirty coffee was served; the latter
was mixed with chicory bark and some bread was eaten with
it. In the evening about nine o'clock, when the first star
was seen or the mark on the block that was being cut could
no longer be seen, we called it a day. Supper was then eaten;
and fifteen minutes later one was asleep in the hay.

This hard work was used by my father as a means to
gain customers and employment. Labor at that time was too
cheap to be competitive with the requests for work. Natur-
ally wages were very low. When we worked by the day for
wages plus meals, the master carpenter received 24 kreuzer,
the journeymen 16 to 18 kreuzer, and I was paid.8.to-..10
kreuzer. The food was the usual farmer's meal, meat being
served two or three times during the week.
16

During this time there was for our family a very
depressing period of three years. My sister, Katharina,
fell ill with a disease that was not known in our part of
the country. It began in the late fall of 1825; and at
first we believed the disease to be the falling sickness
or epilepsy. She threw her body on the ground and her
arms and legs would strike out in all directions. All her
muscles would move out of control. Her tongue would be
cramped and she could not speak. In short, the physical
symptoms were terrible. Father believed her illness to be
epilepsy. An old shepherd was called; it was said that he
had been successful working cures. He tried his art with-
out any success; and said that he could not help as it was
not epilepsy. His statement was true; as we found out later.

Dr. Pfeffer, a good practical physician in our
village, who had studied in Strassburg, was called in. His
patient did not suffer an attack in his presence. We had
observed several times before that as long as a stranger was
present the symptoms would not break out. Father even took
my sister to my aunt, Anna Maria Schmidt. She stayed there
for some time; and while there she did not become ill until
she had been there for two weeks. Then the evil came back
with full force. Dr. Pfeffer wished to observe a seizure,
so Mother took Katharina to him every day. Fourteen days
passed before she fell ill right there. The doctor recog-
nized it as St. Vitus dance of the worst kind, but he could
not help. Dr. Kohler of Laubach was consulted without any
success for a quarter of a year.

When she was in the house, the seizures raged worse.
If I would sing or whistle a tune which she was able to dance
we could hold back the attack for a span of two hours. It
would, however, break out later with severity. The feeling
that she had during the seizures was such that she believed
it started in the stomach. and moved from there first to her
tongue and brain and then to all her limbs. The initial
beginning came as a chill. Becauseâ€™ she had a scabby head
and had to keep it clean, Mother examined and combed her hair
every day; sometimes against Katharina's will.

?

Since no doctor had been-able to help, we resorted
to quackery and witchcraft; this took all of our earnings
and we had to go into debt. Luckily the nights were quiet,
but as soon as day broke the evil returned. Often our pa-
tient would tell us on awaking how many times during the
day she would not feel well; her count was always correct.

It was worse when all the members of the family were at home.
My grandfather Benzel was often alone with her. Even though
he no longer made his home with us, he often stayed in our
home. Then the attacks would happen only three or four times
during the day. Through several unusual phenomena the evil
could be driven away for a short time. At the beginning of
17

her illness my sister was eight years old; and she had
undergone the above circumstances for two and one half
years.

At this time Dr. Pfeffer was visited by a good
friend and colleague of his, Dr. Biederkopf. He had taken
part in Napoleon's invasion of Russia, serving as regi-
mental physician; and had gained great knowledge. Our
doctor told his colleague about the illness of my sister
and supposedly had a consultation with that other doctor
about her. Father was sent for, and was given instruction
concerning future treatment. The patient had to take for
three months three tablespoons of glaubers salt per day.
This was not effective at first, but nature changed and
the desired laxative took effect.

With all these aversions my sister complied for
a quarter of a year, not without strong measures being
taken by my father from time to time. She continued to
take medication; and the illness began to decrease in
occurrence from day to day until after two months it dis-
appeared almost completely. We were not allowed to dis-
cuss the illness with her for several years. When she was
reminded of it she showed signs of impatience but the
seizures never happened again. She is still living in
Chicago; and is in her sixty-fifth year, very healthy.
I should not have dwelled on this incident so long, but
the unusualness of the disease has caused me to do so.

The year 1827 saw a lot of building being done in
Gonterskirchen. Father undertook to build two new farm-
steads, each with a dwelling and a barn, one for Johann
Konrad Graf and the other for Johannes Lind. The buildings
were made from oak logs that we had to cut; even the roof
rafters had to be cut from one or more oak logs. The wood
was cut in the community wood lot. When the logs were cut,
they were trimmed on four sides and measured in cubic feet.
Cost was three or four kreuzer. This price was very cheap.
During this work and the completion of numerous other
repairs, summer came to an end. In the late fall a community
bak house was built, but I did not help to finish this com-
pletely.

Father let me make at home the machines with which
to spin cotton. To speed up the completion of the ones
ordered, Father came home in the evening to help me get the
work done. In the morning he would return to Gonterskirchen
and worked on the bake oven until it was completed. By
Christmas, I had, with my father's help, made thirty-five
spinning wheels at forty kreuzer each. Every two days I
finished one. After Christmas we became wood choppers again.

About this time Father bought a T square from
Frankfurt, made a new drawing board with attachments, and
18

told me that the time had come for me to learn how to
make a drawing. He had purchased a book, Berger's
KNOWLEDGE OF BUILDING, that contained formulae, building
lessons, and information about the different ways of
measuring. The lessons in this book I grasped quickly.

I enjoyed figuring. I could not, as other teen agers,

go out and have fun. I would have liked to have done so,
but my father always determined the time allotted for
study and that always came before play. I had to go to
church twice on Sunday. Often after church service I was
able to join the group; first I had to solve problems
dealing with square or cube root.

To get drawing lessons in our village was most
difficult. We did not have the means for me to study
in other places. Even my wages were necessary for our
domestic needs. Fortunately a journeyman, a mason by the
name of Martin Boning, came to us from far away. He had
worked several years in Frankfurt am Main and had taken
lessons in drawing from an architect named Strobel. Strobel
had gone with Napoleon to Egypt as a building and landscape
inspector. Boning had been able to study with that man
right there in Frankfurt and had mastered all the drawing
necessary in his chosen trade. Boning, who was unmarried,
spent much time with my uncle; my uncle's wife was born
Boning, and the man was her brother.

My father agreed that Martin Boning would give me
drawing lessons as often as possible. I was now cut off
from all boy's foolishness. During the day I became a wood
chopper and in the evening a drawing pupil. In this work I
did find pleasure; and my friendships outside the family
were almost forgotten because of my schedule. I was, in
fact, proud to be learning something that others who were
my equals had not been able to study. I did not regard
myself as being better than they. During the first few
evenings, in the presence of my teacher, several drawings
had to be copied. This gave me practice to help me under-
stand the handling of the drawing instruments. This I
soon understood. He often brought me something different

to study as an example; then I did not see him for a week
or so.

Since Boning was still a bachelor, one could not
blame him as he now was seeking a wife. This matter was
soon taken care of, although he did not marry in haste.
After he had found what he was looking for, he came to
teach me more often; and our work in the candle light pro-
gressed quite well. On occasion I would undertake a
drawing of a wooden building using my own ideas. Under
these conditions, I spent the evenings drawing in the home
of my uncle, Konrad Daehler, for two winters, 1828 and 1829.
19

My uncle was a widower, having lost his wife a
year and a half previous. He was engaged to marry the
youngest sister of his late wife. The marriage took place
at a later date. He was not yet a master carptenter; and
as long as my grandfather was alive, this was all right.
In 1831 my grandfather died. His two sons, my father and
my uncle, both wanted to carry on the trade on their own.
One of them had to become a master carpenter, for the
carpenter's guild insisted on this.

Both brothers ran their business as partners. My
father decided to leave this to become a master carpenter.
At that time the office of the Grand Duke's building master
did not exist. One had only to apply for one's mastership
to the guild master; the knowledge of much theory was not
necessary. Practically both brothers were fine carpenters.
My uncle, however, required more time to complete his share
of the work than my father did; this made him believe that
his work was much better and of nicer quality. Such was not
the case. He began to think that the nails he had not ham-
mered himself were not driven correctly. This became the
reason that he did not keep the journeymen as busy as they
should have been.

Since it was necessary, my uncle reported to the
guild master at the guild hall located in Laubach to es-
tablish himself as a master. After drawing up an agreement
the guild sent two inspecting masters to observe my uncle
in Freienseen. He constructed for them on paper the skele-
ton of a wooden farm house. When the work was done and the
inspection was finished, the best was not forgotten; there
was a good bite to eat and an even petter drink. A contri-
bution to the guild's fund was made, to which my father
added his share; the knighting was done; and my uncle be-
came an honorable master carptenter. Following the comple-
tion of this act, I took the guild oath as an apprentice to
my uncle. Since I had already worked for several years as
a carpenter, I was released immediately and recognized as
a journeyman.

In the year 1828 we had much good work in our own
village. A new building for Karl Immelt, a cloth and silk
dyer, was erected for his house of business; and I had much
fun in working there. I had a feliow journeyman, Georg
Rister; and the two of us worked together. He was several
years older than I. While doing our work, we sometimes sang
songs. As we were eager workers, my father did not object,
for he also loved singing. The building under construction
was two stories high, and consisted of two wings that were
joined at right angles. The roof over these angles required
two long rafters, one on the hip and one on the valley.
20

My uncle called on me to bring him a piece of
pine wood for the ridgepole; it was to measure approxi-
mately eight inches thick and twenty-four feet long.
This I was to cut square; that I did. This particular
piece of wood was to be cut so that the base became an
angle and really was to be the equivalent of half of a
right angle. I started working eagerly. While I was
working I was thinking about the matter carefully and
arrived at the conclusion that all my work was for nought.
Instead of being a right angle this hip rafter, for that
is what it was going to be, had to be cut on a very obtuse
angle in accordance with the area of both roof sections,
roughly about 135 degrees. I then told my uncle, ''God-
father, I think I am doing the work wrong. It should not
be a right angle." "Ach," he replied, "what do you know
about this? You just go ahead and do as I have told you."
I stood, hesitated, and started to speak against his con-
viction. He nearly slapped me. I therefore kept quiet and
did as he had ordered. It amused me greatly when the piece
of wood that had been finished in accordance with my uncle's
instructions was found useless, and had to be discarded.
The reason that I had second thoughts about the above men-
tioned roof section was due to my drafting work. In addi-
tion, during the year different repair work had been done
in Laudenbach and in Gonterskirchen. The year 1829 was a
depression year and that was the reason that farmers had
nothing built. We cut boards and did minor things as they
came along. My father, his brother, and I were usually
able to do the work by ourselves.

During the period of the last mentioned years an
incident happened that grew to be important enough to affect
my whole lifetime. I do not remember the exact year in which
the dwelling of the master baker Heinrich Jung was repaired.
Under the old roof, we had built new outside walls. My fath-
er and journeyman from Wohnfeld, Peter Pabst, did the work.
It happened one Sunday afternoon after I had come home from
church that my father said to me, "I still have to get from
Heinrich Jung the final part of my wages for the carpentry
on his dwelling. He was not going to have the money avail-
able for me until today. Will you go there and see if you
can get it for me?" The house was unfamiliar to me, and I
was not acquainted with the family either. I knew who they
were, but I did not look upon myself as being their equal.

I was shy with them because of those feelings. I went there
anyway and followed my instructions. Frau Jung and several
of her five daughters were at home. The oldest daughter,
Dorothea, was married.

Frau Jung welcomed me and offered me a seat. I
called her Cousin Louisa; and the good woman was very
friendly toward me. She gave me the money for my father.
I was about to leave when she introduced her youngest
21

daughter, Katharina, who had just written the evangelism
for the Sunday catechism class. The manuscript was handed
to me and I was asked to pass my judgment upon it. Louisa
Jung seemed to be very proud of her daughter and of that
daughter's writing as well. I was impressed by the girl
as if I had been struck by lightning. The young and
innocent blossoming girl seemed like a higher creature as
she stood before me and and such an effect on me that I
was not able to response immediately. I soon gathered my
wits about me, and praised the daughter's writing to her
mother. I had come with a quiet heart and was departing
in unrest.

I was not able to understand myself what had
happened to me. Love? This could not and was not per-
mitted to be. First, I was too young, being 18. Second,
public opinion in our village placed me in the class of
the proletariat, whereby I did not have the right to look
up to a girl who belonged to a middle class family. In
general people were rated in relation to their possessions.
My father was a daily wage earner. Her father owned a fine
farm and had one of the best estates, plus additional capi-
tal. An alliance for love was not considered. In spite of
all that I was not able to forget the incident. I met her
often through mutual friends and her older sisters. I did
not dare cultivate friendship for that would have created
a great disturbance.

It was a custom in our village for young people
to meet during the summer after working hours at a suita-
ble place. There several folk songs were sung; and I was
song leader so I dared not be absent. One of the places
we met in was near the Jung home; especially on Sunday
evenings boys and girls gathered there and sang until ten
o'clock. It was an advantage good for me that Herr Jung
was one who enjoyed good singing. In the winter, when the
Jung girls and their girl friends gathered together in
their home to spin, we found ourselves invited to go there
at eight o'clock. Eight o'clock was the hour for all work
to end. We joked a little and sang, but formal etiquette
was followed. The proof of all this is that the master of
the house often sang with us. He even taught me the melody
of the song, "Jesus, My Bridegroom."

The year 1830 brought us much work. The main task
was in Einartshausen, where the mayor, Johannes Keil, had a
splendid dwelling plus a tailor shop built. This kept us
busy all summer. During this year, our village, Freienseen,
had severe hail storms. Fields were ruined and many trees
fell. East of the village in the public field, Allaugh, two
old linden trees were uprooted. Each measured five or six
feet in diameter. They had withstood storms for centuries.
Finally they were unable to withstand the force of the storm
and bowed to great force. It was believed that those two
22

trees dated from the days of St. Boniface. How many church
services must have been held under those holy linden trees.
Today this site is a market place.

The thirties offered good, even, steady work.
Construction was carried on in surrounding villages; for
example, in our village alone new dwellings were built by
Daniel Stein, Johann Kurt Sauer, and Gottlieb Lutz. Joh-
annes Bachmann was building a new barn. In Weikeitsheim,
in Laudenbach, and in Hinartshausen, new buildings were
going up and there was the usual repair work as well.

For sometime I had continued my exercises in
drawing without a teacher. I had even learned geometry so
that I could find an area, figure it, and then divide it
according to the requirements of the circumstance. A law
existed in our village that anybody who was planning to
erect a building, large or small, had to obtain permission
from the county office. The owner of the proposed building
was required to submit a blueprint and a site location plan.
This meant the drawings of the buildings as well as the
location of the buildings in regard to the neighborhood and
street directions. Plans were to be submitted to the mayor
in duplicate. He in turn sent the drawings to county offi-
cials, administrative offices, etc. If he found the reac-
tion favorable, the aforementioned would receive permission,
at times with limited changes. The original copy remained
in the official office; the other covy was filed with the
mayor of the village or town involved, as a means of control,
On request of the owners of proposed new buildings, I com-
pleted many drawings, blueprints, and site location plans.
These always brought me a good side income. Not to waste
time I often worked at night; only the laying out of the
grounds had to be done during the day. For the particular
correctness of this I am responsible. To work out a site
location plan, already mentioned, one needed an understand-
ing of geometry that I had learned.

The county office had issued a regulation that in
Freienseen, in Laudenbach, and in Ilsdorf, young surveyors
were going to be employed. Actually the surveyors did not
always show up when they were needed. Because of that the
mason Georg Boning and I received from our burgomeister,
Johannes Jung, an offer. If we were interested in becoming
surveyors, he would recommend us and then acknowledgement
from the county office would follow. We, of course, agreed.
We collected the necessary information and studied. We
spent the winter of 1829-1830 so occupied. Both of us were
well acquainted with the forest ranger, Dickel, in Laubach.
I was even working in his range as a woodcutter. We con-
vinced him that he should give us lessons for an hour or
two, two evenings a week.
23

Our wood lot was at that time at the Wetterauer-
berg; and Georg Boning's work was at the stone quarry at
Kirchberg, where the new road to Schotten was built. Both
of us were a full hours walking distance from the Dickel
dwelling at Laubach. As soon as we ended our work in the
evening we each started out separately toward the home of
Forest Ranger Dickel. We did this on Tuesday and Friday
nights. After our lesson was finished we started on the
way home to Freienseen, usually arriving there an hour
later around nine o'clock. We were able to take seven
or eight lessons; and then we had to study by ourselves.
Smoll's book on basic mathematics became our teacher. In
the spring of 1830 we.were ordered to report to Ranger H.
Nathan, who gave us the examination. About a week later
we were sworn in as surveyors by County Officer Schurman
at the county court in Laubach.

At this time I became eligible for military duty.
I had no inclination toward the life of a soldier and
could not be spared at home. My father gave 85 florin
into the society managed by Ernst Emil Hoffman. This had
to be done before selection. To my disgust I drew myself
free. I would rather have had a strike so that the
society would have furnished a substitute as the money
had just been paid. The free lot was just as good.

There were at that time eleven recruits eligible
for military service in our village of Freienseen. The
government did not get one of them as a soldier. I list
them in order: ,

Konrad Bachmann, a weaver who had his own business,
Georg Bar, a mason,

Johannes Beir, a smith,

Johann Konrad Daehler, a carpenter,

Johannes Immelt, a farmer, also known as Black Hannes,
Johannes Lober, jackanapes,

Johannes Lobsack, a miller,

Heinrich Moll, a hog dealer and butcher,

Konrad Sauer, a weaver,

J. Konrad Friebart, a weaver,

Heinrich Volp, at that time a dyer in the cotton cloth
factory of the brothers Arnstein at Laubach.

HFOWUANQuURWNEH

At any rate the lots were favorable. Only Lobsack
had a strike. He was represented by the society, so a sub-
stitute was furnished for him. Thanks to the saving ways
of my parents and the continuous work that we had we were
able to pay back the 85 florin, which we had borrowed from

the widow Zooster.

Mother contributed larger amounts to our family
budget as a midwife than what she had earned spinning
cotton. Unfortunately it was not to be to any advantage
because her arthritic condition became worse. Due, to, this,
counting the advantages of the carpentry business, we be-
came wealthier but not happier.
24

If I am not mistaken it was in the year 1833 that
Johannes Dickel had a new two story house built in Freienâ€”
seen. There was so much work that year thatâ€™ we had to split
our man power. I was directed by my father and his brother
to construct the above mentioned building. I was given two
journeymen,- Johannes Pfeiffer and Peter Mulle. This was
the first new building where I was holding the position of
a master and worked independently. We also gained customers
in Laubach, where we kept busy half the summer doing repair
work and straightening out crooked old buildings. Several
journeymen were required. Father was busy with repair work
in Freienseen and in Gonterskirchen.

In the year 1838 a very important chapter in my
life had its beginning. I entered into wedlock with
Katharina Jung. We were married on the eighth of August,
1838. I had not forgotten the incident that took place
between us in the house of her father, the baker Heinrich
Jung and his wife, Louisa.

That we were in love with each other we knew with-
out having to confess it to one another. In society we met
often but thought it wise not to create any disturbance.
There were too many who were jealous of me, especially among
her relatives. Her father did not want her to marry such a
poor young man. She was his youngest daughter and his dar-
ling. Her father had become more fond of me after I im-
pressed him through my behavior, my eagerness, and my desire
to learn. The latter was in our village no common thing.

My parents did not concern themselves with my
affairs. My father's strictness demanded only faultless
behavior. Once gossip had been called to his attention.
Afterward he declared that he did not want his son to go
begging to people where he would perhaps have to expect a
hand out. Here he was very right. I inherited that char-
acteristic from him. Yet, K knew better than any one where
I stood. After I had passed my twentieth year we told each
other of our love and promised that we would wait, hoping
that the opportune time would come. This thought was often
included in my prayers before bed time. Our time did come,
Slowly.

In the fall of the year 1831 Georg Boning and I
had taken over our positions as surveyors in Freienseen,
Laudenbach, and Ilsdorf; we sometimes organized our time
during the week for this work so that our trade did not
suffer any interruption. We found much to do as we had to
regulate in accordnace with the blueprint on file where
the meets and the bounds were indicated. It even happened
On occasion that we started such a task and were not able
to complete it. It had happened in the past that the old
surveyor found it too complicated to regulate building
when the old mark stones had been lost. Instead of sur-
veying to locate the correct points, they obligated them-
25

selves to peaceful negotiations between the parties con-
cerned. This worked but new and different markers were
set up for locations.

Measuring on such a field, we sometimes would
discover that whole new bounds had been worked out on a
blueprint. We were not authorized, without the permis-
sion of the owner, to make any changes; hence, it often
remained the original way. At times those concerned
were very cooperative in regard to drastic deviations.
We in those instances were able to operate in accordance
with the blueprint. This was on occasion the only way
to determine site locations and to end quarrels.

Our earnings were, when we were setting markers,
for the first one placed during the day, 40 kreuzer; for
each one following, 6 Kreuzer. When it happened that no
markers needed to be placed, our fee for one days survey
was 48 kreuzer. For out of town work we charged one gul-
den per day. If the distance were over half an hours
trip, we charged 20 kreuzer additional. Transportation
costs were figured when it involved a whole hour or more.
Property division was paid for by the day in accordance
with instructions issued by the government. We were also
involved when the county court had to settle a dispute or
suit of some kind that involved real estate, then a local

survey was required.
