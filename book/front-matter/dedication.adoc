All of us at one time or another need or
desire information about our families, past and present.
This information is rarely readily available because it
is not an easy task to record it in a simple and
concise form.

Realizing the lack of and also the need for
records of this type, Louis A. Daehler and I originated
the idea of compiling a genealogical work dealing with
the Daehler family. The plan called upon him to handle
the translation of the autobiography of his great-grand-
father and upon me to compile the genealogy of that
gentleman's descendants.

Much effort has been expended in the formation
of this book. The great variety of tasks involved, however,
has made the labor of compilation enjoyable as well
as informative. Numerous relatives and friends have completed
questionnaires. Cemeteries have been visited, and
tombstone inscriptions have been copied. Newspaper files
have been searched. Court and church records, public and
private library resources, and the pages of family records
have been the objects of close scrutiny and study. A
voluminous correspondence with relatives, genealogists,
clergymen, public officials, local historians, and translators
of the German language has been carried on.

It is impossible to cite on a page or two every
instance of time, effort, and energy that has been spent
in research, in investigation, in gathering information,
in checking items for accuracy, in selecting the portions
for inclusion in the final work, in assembling and organizing
the material in an arrangement deemed most suitable, in
writing, in proof reading, and in the correction
of errors in the written results before submitting the
final product for publication.

It took patience and perseverance to complete
this task. Louis's pride and interest in his heritage
remained an inspirational drive for both of us. It is
a matter of deep regret that he did not live to see our
venture completed. He passed away in his Porterville,
California, home on May 21, 1975. It has remained for
me to assemble the work in final form and to present it
for publication.

I know that he would want me to reiterate our
gratitude to three volunteer collectors who so ably
assisted us: his sister, Mrs. Fay H. Reitzel of Sterling,
Ill.; and his cousins, Mrs. John G. Doden of Chadwick,
Ill., and Mrs. Roy E. Schiefelbein of Wichita, Kansas.
There are so many others who did so much that it is
impossible to mention each and every one by name. To each
of you go our sincere thanks. Without your assistance
this book would not have been possible.

In dedicating this book to the memory of
LOUIS ALBERT DAEHLER, I truly hope that these studies
may be a source of pride and personal treasure to you.
May you, in the spirit of the recent research and
publications regarding the history of Carroll County,
Illinois, say with the psalmist:

"My lines have fallen in pleasant places; Yea, I have
a goodly heritage." (Psalms, 16:6)
