On a warm, sunny day in June, 1897, we walked,
we Daehlers, along a woodland path that wound among the
trees, over a little plank bridge, and up to a clearing
at the top of a hill. Here a company of friends, many
of them from far away, were gathered to pay last honor
to him whose body we were that day committing to the
earth. On our way we had passed the vineyard that he
had planted and tended, and the little rustic seats that
he had made under the trees.

The minister said the solemn words of the burial service;
and as the casket descended, the assembled
company sang one more good last hymn: EIN FESTE BURG IST
UNSER GOTT. As the rich German voices echoed against the
wall of forest trees about the clearing, the noble words
and the incomparable music of the hymn seemed to give
assurance that all was well. For like his ancestors before
him, Johann Konrad Daehler was a builder; and his
building was good.

Often my mother had spoken of a manuscript that
Grandfather was supposed to have left, an autobiography.
Often we had wondered what might have become of it. It
was not until some time in 1925, twenty-eight years after
his death, that his granddaughter, my cousin, Dorothea
Smith, found it in a box among some miscellaneous things
in a barn. Dora sent the manuscript, consisting of two
red covered notebooks, to me in Colorado Springs. I at
once put it into typescript, and sent copies back to
Illinois, where they were circulated among those who were
interested.

Now that another generation of descendants is
growing up, most of whom do not read German readily, it
seems desirable that an English translation should be
prepared. For this reason I have undertaken the task.

But there is another motive: it has been fascinating work.
Part of my interest naturally is grounded in a sentiment
of love and respect for the memory of my grandfather. In
addition there is the interest in what now may be regarded
as a first hand historical document. The many technical
problems that have arisen in the work of translation have
been a constant and inspiring challenge to my quite
inadequate knowledge and skill.

Obviously the translation has many faults. The
best I can claim for it is that I have tried to be faith-
ful to the letter and to the spirit of the original. I
have taken few liberties with the text. Obvious misspellings
I have corrected, always noting the original.
Grandfather's manuscript is convincing testimony of the
older systems of pedagogy. He was often beaten, he says,
for poor handwriting, but never for orthography; and he
misspells orthography! His handscript at age seventy-
two was like copper plate, and is clear and legible
after fifty years. The punctuation of course had to be
brought into conformity with English syntax. I have
sought to render the simplicity and honesty of the
original text. What interest there is in the text is
owing to the character and intelligence of the author;
the weaknesses I fear must be attributed to the translator.

NOTE: The autobiography and translation have remained
in manuscript form all these years. Albert H. Daehler
did present a copy of the English translation to the
library of the National Carl Schurz Association in
Philadelphia. In 1944 that organization published two
extracts from it in their bi-monthly periodical, THE
AMERICAN GERMAN REVIEW. The August, 1944, selection
(Vol. X, pp. 28-9) deals with the trip to and the
arrival in the United States. The October, 1944,
selection (Vol. XI, pp. 26-9) describes the difficulties
that faced the pioneers in settling in Fair Haven Township,
Carroll County, Illinois. Both articles appeared
under the title: THE KIND OF STUFF THAT MADE AMERICA
WHAT IT IS TODAY.
