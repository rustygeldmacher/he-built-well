== Emigration

On April 20, 1855,Â°in the evening, after sundown,
we took the first important and definite step for
emigration from our dear homeland into a world known only from
hearsay. We did so with the greatest confidence in
Providence, Who had manifested Himself repeatedly in the course
of my life as a Guardian Spirit of Protection; and I
acknowledge this gratefully. We; my son, Louis, who was 13,
my daughter, who was 11, and I; together with our relative,
Henry Benzel, age 14, went to Laubach, where we spent the
night at the Sose Inn, which was owned by Johann Seitz.
My wife and our son, Henry, age 16, left a week before to
visit relatives in Ginheim, near Frankfurt. On April 21st,
in the morning I called on Dr. Steinmetz one more time to
say good bye to him for good. Then we took the stage coach
to Friedberg; there we boarded the train that carried us to
Frankfurt. We arrived and proceeded to the homes of
relatives. The following week we went to Maintz. I entered
into an agreement with a neighbor, J. K. Hoffmann, a man
who hired out to do hauling, and with Christian Bachman,
who had to escort the load, to bring our luggage to Mainz.

We with our luggage were put on board a steamship
on the 23rd to begin the trip down the Rhine. At the dock
an already fairly large group of emigrants had gathered.
The trip down the Rhine went fairly well. At noon we stopped
at Cologne, and stayed over night in an inn in Rotterdam.
From there we sailed across the Channel to London; there was
great misery among the passengers due to sea sickness. The
Channel was turbulent; sea sickness struck without finding
much resistance; yet we all arrived well but very weakened
and lame in London.

Arriving at one of those travelers hotels, one
would have liked to lie down and get some sleep; but after
drinking a cup of coffee, we were driven like a herd of
sheep to the harbor where we had to board the sailing ship
that was to take us to New York. It happened to be low
tide, and we stumbled through the mud to reach a 16 foot
long ladder that was our means to climb aboard our ship,
where we spent the night. I no longer remember the name of
the ship. A great many necessities were still to be brought
aboard since, according to our travel contract, we were
receiving only partial board. There were thus many things
that we still intended to buy for the voyage; e.g., potatoes,
eggs, hams, and straw filled mattresses. The partial board
that we were to get we learned consisted of tea, sugar,
zweiback, and drinking water. We were given so much of the
latter that we used it for cooking too. We had taken along
for housekeeping much foodstuff: zweiback, meat, wurst,
sauerkraut, peas, coffee, eggs, cheese, butter, condensed
milk, wine, and rum; in fact, we had so much that we did
not have to buy any of the stores delivered to the ship.
I did buy potatoes in London harbor. There were several
hundred passengers; perhaps three hundred of them were
German; the rest were Irish, French, Swiss, Italian, and
two Chinese men.

The first week the voyage went quite well; the
wind was always favorable. The second week it was
alternately stormy or calm. After having spent thirty days
aboard we sighted the coast of New York. It was the
Monday of Pentecost, and was becoming dark as our ship
entered New York harbor. We spent that night on board.
The captain of our ship, Braddish, was an American who
favored the Germans a great deal. We awarded him a
certificate of appreciation for our good treatment. Next
morning, May 29th, we disembarked, went into New York
City, and took lodging in a guest house at 78 Greenwich
Street; our landlord was Joseph Strebel, a German from
Worms. Our luggage, for which I had paid transportation
from London to Albany, was loaded onto a boat and brought
to a railroad depot along the Hudson River. The guest
house in which we had stayed was so over crowded that not
everyone had a place to sleep. The innkeeper showed
himself quite intelligent on this occasion; he gave several
kegs of beer to the young men so that they drank and sang
all night. Unfortunately we who had beds could not get
any sleep either.

With this my life in Europe is ended. The
continuation will be of my experiences in America.

NOTE: Research notes left by Albert H. Daehler state
that the name of the vessel was the ASHBURTON. She was
an American vessel, registered at about 1,020 tons; and
carried 446 passengers. Also on board was cargo
consigned to C. Grinnell.
